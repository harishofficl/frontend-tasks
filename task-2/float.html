        Pineapple (Ananas comosus) is a tropical fruit. It contains nutrients,
        antioxidants, and other compounds, such as enzymes that can protect
        against inflammation and disease. It's commonly eaten baked, grilled, or
        freshly cut. Pineapple and its compounds are linked to several health
        benefits, including improvements in digestion, immunity, and recovery
        from surgery. The pineapple is indigenous to South America, where it has
        been cultivated for many centuries. The introduction of the pineapple
        plant to Europe in the 17th century made it a significant cultural icon
        of luxury. Since the 1820s, pineapple has been commercially grown in
        greenhouses and many tropical plantations.

        characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Its progression is commonly
        linked to oxidative stress and chronic inflammationTrusted Source.
        Several studies note that pineapple and its compounds, including
        bromelain, may reduce cancer riskTrusted Source by minimizing oxidative
        stress and reducing inflammation. However, further research in humans is
        still needed to confirm its exact effects.
